## About me
I'm a young man who love talk about how the mind work and explain how we our problem arise inside our brain.
I love understand how the things work and love tell for other people about what I learn, because the learning is only worthwhile if i can share her with other people.
I choise programmation because I feel who I can do all and I feel free.
I belive who if you have a brain able of learn, have access to information and have opportunity for show who is able, you can go 
wherever you want and only you define your limite.
